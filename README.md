# Numeric-Methods

This project contains multiple small programs that implement various **numerical methods** for solving mathematical problems. These methods cover approximation techniques, integration, interpolation, nonlinear equations, and several matrix factorization algorithms. The goal is to provide efficient solutions for common numerical tasks and showcase different approaches for solving mathematical problems.

## 🔧 Features

This project includes implementations of the following numerical methods:

### 📐 Approximation
A set of techniques used to approximate functions, including methods for approximating the roots of functions, numerical derivatives, and other approximation strategies.

### 📚 Integral
This section contains implementations of numerical integration methods, such as the Trapezoidal Rule and Simpson's Rule, for approximating the value of definite integrals.

### 🔄 Lagrange Interpolation
This method constructs an interpolating polynomial that passes through a given set of data points, useful for interpolation tasks when working with discrete data.

### 🧩 Newton Interpolation
This folder provides the **Newton’s Divided Difference** method, which constructs a polynomial that fits a given dataset and is particularly useful for interpolating tabulated data.

### 🔢 NonLinear Equation
A collection of numerical methods designed to solve **nonlinear equations**. Methods like the **Bisection Method**, **Newton-Raphson Method**, and **Secant Method** are implemented to solve equations that cannot be easily solved analytically.

### 🔻 RURL-Gauss
This method involves solving systems of linear equations using **Gaussian Elimination**. It is implemented as part of the project for solving general systems of equations.

### 🔲 RURL-Jacobin
This method applies the **Jacobian Matrix** for solving systems of nonlinear equations iteratively. The Jacobian method is an important approach in numerical analysis, particularly in solving systems of equations arising in various scientific computations.

### 🔄 RURL-LU Decomposition
Here, the **LU Decomposition** technique is used for solving systems of linear equations. LU Decomposition is a useful technique in numerical linear algebra to simplify solving linear systems.

### 🔀 RURL-Pivoting
This method uses **Pivoting** techniques, such as Partial Pivoting, for improving the stability of Gaussian Elimination and LU Decomposition when solving systems of linear equations.
